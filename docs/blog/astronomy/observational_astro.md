The basics of Observational Astronomy

### The celestial sphere, coordinates and planning observations

- great circle: whose diameter is alse a diameter of the sphere.

- Equator: the great circle **perpendicular** to the axis of Earth's rotation

- latitude (angle): positive towards the North, and negative towards the South

- the circle of latitude: the small circle **parallel** to the Equator

- longitude (angle): positive towards the East, and negative towards the West

- meridian: any great circle **perpendicular** to the Equator

- prime meridian: the meridian passing through the Royal Greenwich Observatory in the UK

#### celestial sphere

- celestial sphere

- celestial equator

- the North and South celestial poles

#### coordinates

- Equatorial Coordinates: **declination** and **right ascension**

<!-- ![picture of dec and ra]() -->

- Declination ( $\mathbf{Dec}$ or $\delta$): extension of latitude

- ecliptic: the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun

- equinox points: ecliptic & celestial equator
  
  Vernal/Spring equinox: March (the start point for measuring right ascension)

  Autumn equinox: September

- Right Ascension ( $\mathbf{RA}$ or $\alpha$): extension of longitude
  
  only positive; given in **hours (0-24)** or **degrees ($0^\circ$ - $360^\circ$)**

- zenith: the top of observers on the celestial sphere

- Horizontal coordinates

  **Azimuth** (Az) and **Altitude** (Alt)

- Azimuth (N-E-S-W)

- Altitude: runs from $0^\circ$ at the horizon to $90^\circ$ at the zenith

#### planning observations

the staralt tool: [https://astro.ing.iac.es/staralt/](https://astro.ing.iac.es/staralt/)

- Local Sidereal Time (LST): the right ascension of the local zenith

- considerations:
  1. what is my desired altitude (Dec)
  2. how long do I want to observe (RA and Dec)

### Telescopes and Mounts

#### telescopes

two types of telescopes:
- Refractors (use lenses)
- Reflectors (use mirrors)
  - Newtonian (one mirror with optical power)
  - Compact (two mirror with optical power)

basic definitions for optics:
- Focus/focal point
- focal length ($F$)

$$
\text{pixel scale}=206.265\times\frac{\text{pixelsize}[\mu m]}{F[mm]}\quad\left[\frac{\text{arcsec}}{\text{pixel}}\right]
$$

#### mounts

- Equatorial (follow RA and Dec)

- Altazimuthal (follow Az and Alt)

### The GT80 - other parts of the telescope

- the mount point of CCD:
  - Nasmyth focal points
  - Cassegrain focal points
  - prime focus points

- Field rotation: rotating the CCD counter clock-wise when looking East
