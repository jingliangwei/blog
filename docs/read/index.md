# Essay with papers/books

There are some notes that record some key points from papers or books.

## dynamics in strained rotating flow

July in 2025

the [pdf](/read/chaotic-dynamics-in-a-strained-rotating-flow-a-precessing-plane-fluid-layer.pdf) of paper *chaotic dynamics in a strained rotating flow: a precessing plane fluid layer*

the paper is aviliable at [http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112002001994](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112002001994)

the [note](/read/dynamics-in-strained-rorating-flow) record the details of the math process in the linear part.

## the disk-satellite interaction

August in 2025

the papers:

1. [GT79](/read/goldreich-tremaine-1979.pdf) *the excitation of density waves at the Lindblad and corotaion resonances by an external potential*

2. [GT80](/read/goldreich-tremaine-1980.pdf) *disk-satellite interactions*

3. [yang-li-2024](/read/yang-li-2024.pdf) *mean-motion resonances with interfering density waves*

the [note](/read/disk-satellite) contains:

- the [epicyclic frequency](/read/disk-satellite#basic-conception)
- the [Lindblad and corotation resonance](/read/disk-satellite#ii-basic-equations) (see the box under the Eq. 13)
