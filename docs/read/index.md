# Essay with papers

There are some notes that record some key points from papers.

## dynamics in strained rotating flow

summer in 2025

the [pdf](/read/chaotic-dynamics-in-a-strained-rotating-flow-a-precessing-plane-fluid-layer.pdf) of paper *chaotic dynamics in a strained rotating flow: a precessing plane fluid layer*

the paper is aviliable at [http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112002001994](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112002001994)

the [note](/read/dynamics-in-strained-rorating-flow) record the details of the math process in the linear part.
